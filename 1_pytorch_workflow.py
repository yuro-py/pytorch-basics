import torch

# one of many pytorch's workflow:-
# 1. get data ready(turn to tensors)
# 2. build/pick a pre-trained model
#     2.1 pick a loss function and optimizer
#     2.2 build a training loop
# 3. fit the model to a data and make a prediction, or TRAINING
# 4. evaluate the model
# 5. improve through experimentation
# 6. save and reload your trained model
